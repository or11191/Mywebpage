  <h5> The first thing i am gong to talk about is the stadium. Stamford Bridge. This stadium is a historic place, it was built in April 28, 1877. 
    This makes it one of the longest opened stadiums in the premier league. Stamford bridge is the best stadium in london, with the hisory and looks.
    Compared to other Premier League stadiums, Stamford Bridge is actually not that large. With the maximum stadium capacity at just over 40,000, 
    it doesn't even rank in the top 5 for Premier League football stadiums. Initially the stadium was offered to nearby Fulham FC to play there. 
    They turned down the chance and so instead a new side, Chelsea Football Club, was born in March 1905 and moved into the new Stamford Bridge
    stadium for the start of the season a few months later.
